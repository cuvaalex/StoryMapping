This a PetShop project to learn React.
I started with the idea to create a solution for the Product Owner to follow their Product Life cycle. The business is not so simple, neither to complex. but it allw me to interact with different part of a traditionel solution.

**Architecture**
Here are my first hypothesys on what I will use:
* React.js
* Use in conjunction with Next.js: I read a lot of good things about Next.js, so let's have a try
* For the style, instead use something around CSS, like LESS or SASS, JASS I will use **Material-UI** it allow to use Google Material Design with React. This allow us to simplify the design as I m not a designer it would be great.
* I don't know yet if I will use Redux or what it is provided with Next.
